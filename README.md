# REFPROP-issues
A repository solely used for reporting issues with NIST REFPROP

If as a user you have specific problems with NIST REFPROP (http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist23.cfm), we invite you to seek assistance by filing an issue by clicking on the Issues button to the right (the one with the exclamation point), and reporting the problem

Before you report an issue, please:

* Ensure that you have fully read the frequently asked questions page for REFPROP: http://www.boulder.nist.gov/div838/theory/refprop/Frequently_asked_questions.htm
* Be aware that all issues are publicly accessible and viewable.  Thus please do not post any code or other content that is protected intellectual property or under copyright.
* Provide a complete working (or not-working) example. "It doesn't work" is not a helpful comment.  "When I calculate the saturation temperature of water using REFPROP at 101325 Pa I get 300 K, but I should get ~373.1 K" is much better.
